# ContaBanco

Simple CLI exercise for creating a bank account.

This exercise is part of the Santander 2025 Bootcamp - Back-End with Java by DIO (Digital Innovation One).

This exercise helped me revisit the basics of the Java language.

## Most important commands

Check Java version (needs a recent JDK; this source uses unnamed class `main` preview):

```sh
java -version
```

Compile (enable preview features for unnamed class `main`):

```sh
javac --release 21 --enable-preview src/ContaTerminal.java
```

Run (also enable preview features):

```sh
java --enable-preview -cp src ContaTerminal
```
